        <h2>Journal</h2> 
        <p>Today, I took a moment to envision myself five years from now,
              contemplating where I want to be and what I want to achieve. The
              journey has been challenging, especially in the IT industry, with
              its stress and pressure lingering over the past few months and
              potentially continuing in the weeks to come. As I reflect on 
              this path, I question whether it is worth it.<br><br>Honestly,
              as of now, I don't picture myself thriving in the IT industry
              five years down the road. The challenges seem daunting, and the
              allure of this field hasn't quite captured my passion. However,
              I hold onto the hope that time might alter my perspective.
              Perhaps the experiences yet to unfold will reshape my outlook,
              and the skills I gain will become a source of fulfillment.
              <br><br>In stark contrast, my vision for the future places me in
              the film industry. I see myself immersed in the world of cinema,
              a realm where my passion thrives and creativity knows no bounds.
              Interestingly, I find solace in the fact that, as of now, the 
              film industry is not just a distant dreamâ€”it's a reality. I've
              carved my niche, and the financial returns are promising.<br><br>
              The decision to navigate towards the film industry stems from a
              deep-seated love for storytelling and the visual arts. While the
              path may be unpredictable, the prospect of contributing to the
              creation of captivating narratives and cinematic wonders excites
              me. It's not just a career; it's my business, and the returns,
              both creatively and financially, have been gratifying.<br><br>As
              I assess the worth of the challenges faced in the IT industry, I
              find myself leaning towards the prospect of a future in film.
              The contrast between the two worlds is stark, and the desire for
              a fulfilling and creatively satisfying career propels me towards
              the film industry. Only time will reveal if this vision holds
              true or if unforeseen opportunities and experiences in the IT
              sector can alter the course of my professional journey.<br><br>
              In the coming weeks, I'll continue to navigate the challenges of
              being an IT student while keeping a watchful eye on the evolving
              dreams that may shape my destiny. Until then, I remain open to
              the possibilities that the future holds, ready to adapt and
              embrace the path that resonates most with my aspirations.</p>
